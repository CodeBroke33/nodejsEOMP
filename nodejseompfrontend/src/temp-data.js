Recycled PET (polyethylene terephthalate) can be reused in clothes (polyester staple fibre/filament), duvets, pillows, carpeting and even plastic bottles as well. Learn more about our recycling initiatives here.Mineral water has been proven to contribute to your heart health.A study was done, where women drank 1 litre of sodium-rich mineral water per day for two months each. The results showed that mineral water intake raised the levels of good (HDL) cholesterol whilst lowering bad cholesterol.Lowering blood pressure\n\nMineral water rich in magnesium can help lower your blood pressure. In 2004 a study was done on people who had borderline hypertensive (high BP). They were each given 1 litre of mineral water to drink daily, and after 4 weeks they noticed a significant reduction in the blood pressures of this group.\n\nStrengthening bones\n\nMineral water is also high in calcium which our body uses in the creation and strengthening of bones. In 2017 researchers studied how the body absorbs calcium from milk, calcium supplements, and mineral water. They concluded that mineral water with high amounts of calcium can, in fact, improve the body’s calcium supply.\n\nRelieving Symptoms of Constipation\n\nThe magnesium in mineral water can help relieve the symptoms of constipation. Magnesium draws water into the intestines, which improves your stool consistency. It also relaxes the intestinal muscles, supporting regular bowel movements."

    description: "S.Pellegrino Carbonated Natural Mineral Water is a fine quality mineral water that flows from a natural spring in the San Pellegrino Terme area in Val Brembana, in the foothills of the Italian Alps. Just like wine, each natural mineral water has its own distinctive ‘terroir’, a French term meaning the unique environment that determines its signature mineral content.While the water flows through the rock in the mountain, it becomes naturally enriched with minerals. Adding carbon dioxide provides acidity to the water and prolongs the sparkling water's scent and taste. This water finishes with a slightly bitter note and with its gentle bubbles, subtle nuances, and perfect mineral balance it is internationally renowned as a fine dining mineral water to pair with food.
